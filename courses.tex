\section*{PO-235 Data Science Project}

\emph{Course plan}

\nth{1} Semester of \the\year{}

Prof. Filipe A. N. Verri

\paragraph{Number of students:} Approx. 20 (hopefully close to 10)

\paragraph{Course load:} 3--0--0--4

\paragraph{Requirements:} Advanced programming skills, strong statistics background, and
beginner level machine learning skills.

\paragraph{Course program:}
Brief history of Data Science.  Fundamental data concepts. Stages in a Data Science
project.  Data Infrastructure. Data integration from multiple sources. Data engineering
and shaping.  Inductive learning and principles of Statistical Learning Theory.
Application of Machine Learning models in real-world problems.  Experimental planning for
Data Science. Model evaluation and Bayesian analysis.  Documentation and deployment.
Ethical and legal issues in Data Science.  Privacy-preserving computational approaches.

\paragraph{Goals:}
Providing the theoretical background and the practical concepts to develop an end-to-end
data science project for an inductive task.

\paragraph{Teaching methodology:}
Expository classes in common classroom, using whiteboard, slide presentations, coding
examples, books and scientific papers. Supplementary didactic materials will be available
in Google Classroom. The development of the case study will happen during home study
hours, including programming and scientific paper writing.

\paragraph{Grading:} Two individual written tests in the \nth{1} and another in the \nth{2} quarter.
Scientific paper and oral presentation about the case study for the final exam.

\paragraph{Bibliography:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Nina Zumel and John Mount. Practical Data Science with R. Manning, 2nd Edition, 2019.
  \item Hadley Wickham and Garret Grolemund, R for Data Science: Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data. O’Reilly Media, 2017.
  \item John D. Kelleher and Brendan Tierney. Data Science, MIT Press, 2018.

\section*{CMC-1X Practical Data Science}

\emph{Course plan}

\nth{1} Semester of \the\year{}

Prof. Filipe A. N. Verri

\paragraph{Number of students:} Approx. 20

\paragraph{Course load:} 2--0--1--5

\paragraph{Requirements:} CMC-13 or CMC-15

\paragraph{Course program:}
Brief history of Data Science. Stages in a Data Science project. Tidy Data. Data
integration from multiple sources. Data engineering and shaping. Inductive learning and
Statistical Learning Theory. Experimental planning for Data Science. Model evaluation and
Bayesian Analysis. Documentation and deployment. Privacy-preserving computational
approaches.

\paragraph{Goals:}
Further studying the practical aspects of Data Science (in relation to CMC-13) and providing
the mathematical foundations to ensure the correct usage of Data Science techniques.

The specific goals are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Understanding the steps and people involved in Data Science projects;
  \item Developing an end-to-end case study, including data collection, data transformation,
    inductive learning, validation, documentation, and deployment; and
  \item Critically evaluate the results and implications of the case study.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Teaching methodology:}
Expository classes in common classroom, using whiteboard, slide presentations, coding
examples, books and scientific papers. Supplementary didactic materials will be available
in Google Classroom. The development of the case study will happen during laboratory
classes and home study hours, including programming and writing essays.

\paragraph{Grading:} One individual written test in the \nth{1} and another in the \nth{2} quarter.
Essay and oral presentation about the case study (in groups) for the final exam.

\paragraph{Bibliography:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Nina Zumel and John Mount. Practical Data Science with R. Manning, 2nd Edition, 2019.
