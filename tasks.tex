\chapter{Machine learning tasks}

In the previous chapter, we define two fundamental inductive learning tasks:
\emph{classification} and \emph{regression}.  In real-world applications, however, we may
require different tasks to solve our data science problem.  Descriptive learning tasks are
out of the scope of this book, I suggest reading \dots. Even restricting ourselves to
discuss only inductive learning, some machine learning tasks comprise a combination of
fundamental tasks.
