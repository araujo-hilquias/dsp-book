\emph{Course plan}

\nth{1} Semester of \the\year{}

Prof. Filipe A. N. Verri

\paragraph{Number of students:} Approx. 20

\paragraph{Course load:} 2--0--1--5

\paragraph{Requirements:} CMC-13 or CMC-15

\paragraph{Course program:}
Brief history of Data Science. Stages in a Data Science project. Tidy Data. Data
integration from multiple sources. Data engineering and shaping. Inductive learning and
Statistical Learning Theory. Experimental planning for Data Science. Model evaluation and
Bayesian Analysis. Documentation and deployment. Privacy-preserving computational
approaches.

\paragraph{Goals:}
Further studying the practical aspects of Data Science (in relation to CMC-13) and providing
the mathematical foundations to ensure the correct usage of Data Science techniques.

The specific goals are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Understanding the steps in a Data Science project;
  \item Developing an end-to-end case study, including data collection, data transformation,
    inductive learning, validation, documentation, and deployment; and
  \item Critically evaluate the results and implications of the case study.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Teaching methodology:}
Expository classes in common classroom, using whiteboard, slide presentations, coding
examples, books and scientific papers. Supplementary didactic materials will be available
in Google Classroom. The development of the case study will happen during laboratory
classes and home study hours, including programming and writing essays.

\paragraph{Grading:} One written test in the \nth{1} and one in the \nth{2} quarter.
Essay describing the development of the case study for the final exam.
