  abstract = {A comprehensive review of the pre-Holocene palaeoart evidence from sub-Saharan Africa is presented. The scant figurative component appears to be entirely confined to the Later Stone Age. Beads and pendants range back further, to the latter half of the Middle Stone Age. The same applies to the notched items that are invariably based on either bone or red ochre. Incised lines have been reported from both of those periods, and extend into the preceding Early Middle Stone Age. Preliminary data would suggest that a comparable timespan is probably covered by cupules and grooves. Pigment manuports, sometimes with use damage, are traceable to late in the Earlier Stone Age. And lastly are occasional exotic manuports, the collection of which could have spanned the entire Stone Age.},

  abstract = {Future users of large data banks must be protected from having to know how the data is organized in the machine (the internal representation). A prompting service which supplies such information is not a satisfactory solution. Activities of users at terminals and most application programs should remain unaffected when the internal representation of data is changed and even when some aspects of the external representation are changed. Changes in data representation will often be needed as a result of changes in query, update, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored information.Existing noninferential, formatted data systems provide users with tree-structured files or slightly more general network models of the data. In Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed. A model based on n-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations, and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced. In Section 2, certain operations on relations (other than logical inference) are discussed and applied to the problems of redundancy and consistency in the user's model.},
