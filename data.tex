\chapter{Fundamental data concepts}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Variables, types etc
  \item Records
  \item Tidy data
\end{itemize}

The obvious start point for someone studying data science is the definition of the term
itself.

For \textcite{Zumel2019}, \emph{``data science is a cross-disciplinary practice that draws
on methods from data engineering, descriptive statistics, data mining, machine learning,
and predictive analytics.''}  They compare the area with the operations research, stating
that data science focuses on implementing data-driven decisions and managing their
consequences.

\textcite{Hickham2023} state that \emph{``data science is an exciting discipline that
allows you to transform raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge.''}

I find the first definition too restrictive once new methods and techniques are always
under development.  We never know when new ``data-related'' methods will become obsolete
or a trend.  Also, \textcite{Zumel2019}'s view gives the impression that data science is a
operations research subfield.  Although I will not try to prove otherwise, I think it will
be much more useful to see it as an independent field of study.  (Obviously, there will be
many intersections between both areas, but I will try my best to keep definitions and
terms standardized throughout chapters, sometimes avoiding popular terms that may generate
ambiguities or confusion.)

The second one is not really a definition.  However, it states clearly \emph{what} data
science enables us to do.  From this thought, let's define the term.

\begin{displayquote}
  \em
  Data science is the study of computational methods to extract knowledge from
  measurable phenomena.
\end{displayquote}

I want to highlight some terms in this definition.  \emph{Computational methods} means
that data science methods use computers to handle data and perform the calculations.
\emph{Knowledge} means information that humans can easily understand or apply to solve
problems.  \emph{Measurable phenomena} are events or processes where raw data can be
quantified in some way.  \emph{Raw data} are data collected directly from some source and
that have not been subject to any other manipulation by a software program or a human
expert.
