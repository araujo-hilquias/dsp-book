\chapter{Data science project}

First of all, a data science project is a software project.  The difference between a data
science software and a traditional software is that some components of the former is
constructed from data.  This means that part of the solution cannot be designed from the
knowledge of the domain expert, but must be learned from the data.  (Alternatively, the
cost of designing the solution is too high, and it is more efficient to learn it from the data.)

One good example of a data science project is a spam filter.  The spam filter is a software
that classifies emails into two categories: spam and non-spam.  The software is trained
using a set of emails that are already classified as spam or non-spam.  The software is
then used to classify new emails.  The software is a data science software because the
classification algorithm is learned from the data, i.e. the filters are not designed ``by
hand''.
