There are many points-of-view about the beginning of data science.  For the sake of
contextualization, I separate the topic in two approaches: the history of the term itself
and a broad timeline of data-driven sciences highlighting the important figures in each
age.

\section{The term ``data science''}

The term data science is recent and has been used to label rather different fields of
study.  In the following, I emphasize the history of a few notable usage of the term.

\paragraph{Peter Naur (1928 -- 2016)}

The term ``data science'' itself was coined in the 1960s by Peter Naur (/naʊə/). Naur was
a Danish computer scientist and mathematician who made significant contributions to the
field of computer science, including his work on the development of programming
languages\footnote{He is best remembered as a contributor, with John Backus, to the
Backus–Naur form (BNF) notation used in describing the syntax for most programming
languages.}.
His ideas and concepts laid the groundwork for the way we think about programming and data
processing today.

\begin{mainbox}{Peter Naur}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Danish computer scientist and mathematician.
    \item Coined the term ``data science'' in the 1960s.
    \item Proposed the term ``datalogy'' as an alternative to computer science.
  \end{itemize}
\end{mainbox}

Naur disliked the term computer science and suggested it be called datalogy or data
science.  In the 1960s, the subject was practised in Denmark under Peter
Naur's term datalogy, which means the science of data and data processes.

He coined this term to emphasize the importance of data as a fundamental component of
computer science and to encourage a broader perspective on the field that included
data-related aspects. At that time, the field was primarily centered on programming
techniques, but Naur's concept broadened the scope to recognize the intrinsic role of data
in computation.

In his book\footnote{Peter Naur: Concise Survey of Computer Methods, 397 p.
Studentlitteratur, Lund, Sweden, ISBN 91-44-07881-1, 1974.
\url{http://www.naur.com/Conc.Surv.html}}, ``Concise Survey of Computer Methods'', he
parts from the concept that \emph{data} is ``a representation of facts or ideas in a
formalised manner capable of being communicated or manipulated by some
process.''\footnote{I. H. Gould (ed.): ‘IFIP guide to concepts and terms in data
processing’, North-Holland Publ. Co., Amsterdam, 1971.} Note however that his view of the
science only ``deals with data [\dots] while the relation of data to what they represent
is delegated to other fields and sciences.''

    where it is enlarged by computer science and domain expertise.
  }
  \label{fig:cleveland}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{William Cleveland (born 1943)}

In 2001, a prominent statistician used the term ``data science" in his work to describe a
new discipline that comes from his ``plan to enlarge the major areas of technical work of
the field of statistics\footnote{W. S. Cleveland. Data Science: An Action Plan for
Expanding the Technical Areas of the Field of Statistics. ISI Review, 69:21–26, 2001.}.''
In 2014, that work was republished\footnote{W. S. Cleveland.
Data Science: An Action Plan for the Field of Statistics. Statistical Analysis and Data
Mining, 7:414–417, 2014. reprinting of 2001 article in ISI Review, Vol 69.}.
He advocates the expansion of statistics beyond theory into technical areas, significantly
changing statistics.  Thus, it warranted a new name.

\begin{mainbox}{William Cleveland}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item American statistician.
    \item Proposed the discipline ``data science'' in 2001.
    \item Proposed the term ``data science'' as the new name for expansion of statistics.
  \end{itemize}
\end{mainbox}

As a result, William Swain Cleveland II is credited to define data science as it is most
used today. He is a highly influential figure in the fields of statistics, machine
learning, data visualization, data analysis for multidisciplinary studies, and high
performance computing for deep data analysis.

\paragraph{Buzzword or a new science?}

Be aware that literature has no consensus on the definition of data science, and it is still considered
by some to be a buzzword\footnote{Press, Gil. "Data Science: What's The Half-Life of a
Buzzword?". Forbes. Available at
\url{https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2013/08/19/data-science-whats-the-half-life-of-a-buzzword/}}.

Most of the usages of the term in literature and in the media are either a rough
reference to a set of data-driven techniques or a marketing strategy.  Naur
(\cref{fig:naur}) and Cleveland (\cref{fig:cleveland}) are among the few that try to
carefully define the term.  However, both of them do not see data science as an
independent field of study, but an enlarged scope of an existing science.  I disagree;
the social and economical demand for data-driven solutions led to an evolution in our
understanding of the challenges we are facing.  As a result, we see many ``data
scientist'' being hired and many ``data science degrees'' programs emerging.

In \cref{chap:data}, I dare to provide a (yet another) definition for the term.  I
argue that its object of study can be precisely established to support it as a new
science.

\begin{mainbox}{A new science}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Both Naur and Cleveland do not see data science as an independent field of study.
    \item I argue that data science is not a buzzword.
    \item Our social and economical reality demands a new science.
  \end{itemize}
\end{mainbox}

\section{Timeline and historical markers}

\textcite{Kelleher2018} provides an interesting time line of data-driven methods and
influential figures in the field.  I reproduce it here with some minor changes, including
some omissions and additions.

Like \citeauthor{Kelleher2018}, I address data collection, and then data analysis.

\subsection{Timeline of data collection}

The importance of collecting data goes without saying.  Data fuels analysis and
decision making.  In the following, I present some of the most important milestones in the history
of data collection.

% A TikZ picture with the data collection timeline.

    \foreach \x in {0,1,...,8} {
      \draw (\x,-0.1) -- (\x,0.1);
    }
    \foreach \x/\y in {0/Pre-digital Age, 2/Digital Age, 4/Formal Age, 6/Integrated Age, 8/Ubiquitous Age} {
      \node[anchor=north] at (\x,-0.1) {\footnotesize\y};
    }
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{
    Timeline of the ages of data collection.
  }
  \label{fig:collection-history}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:collection-history} illutrates the timeline.

\subsubsection{Pre-digital age}

We can consider the earliest records of data collection to be the notches on sticks and
bones to keep tracking of passing of time.  The Lebombo bone, a baboon fibula with
notches, is probably the earliest known mathematical object.  It was found in the Lebombo
Mountains located between South Africa and Eswatini.
They estimate it is more
than 40,000 years old. It is conjectured to be a tally stick, but its exact purpose is
unknown. Its 29 notches suggests that may have been used as a lunar phase counter.
However, since it is broken at one end, the 29 notches may or may not be the total
number\footcite{Beaumont2013}.

Since the early forms of writing, humanity abilities to record events and information
increased significantly.  The first known written records date back to 3,500 BC, the
Sumerian archaic (pre-cuneiform) writing.  This writing system was used to represent
commodities using clay tokens and to record transactions\footcite{Ifrah1998}.

Another important milestone in the history of data collection is the record of
demographic data.  One of first known census was conducted in 3,800 BC in the Babylonian
Empire.  It was ordered to assess the population and resources of
his empire\footcite{Grajalez2013}.

Moving forward many years, I consider a major influential figure in the history of data
collection to be Florence Nightingale (1820 -- 1910).  She was a passionate statistician
and probably the first person to use statistics to influence public and official
opinion.  The meticulous records she kept during the Crimean War
(1853 -- 1856) were the evidence that saved lives.  She was also the first to use
statistical graphics to present data in a way that was easy to understand.  She is
credited with developing a form of the pie chart now known as the polar area
diagram.  She also reformed healthcare in the United Kingdom and
is considered the founder of modern nursing\footcite{Grajalez2013}.

\begin{mainbox}{Florence Nightingale}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Passionate statistician.
    \item First person to use statistics to influence public and official opinion.
    \item Organized data from garden fruits and vegetables into numerical tables at the age of 9.
    \item At 20 she was receiving two-hour lessons from a Cambridge-trained mathematician.
    \item She found the sight of a long column of figures “perfectly reviving”.
    \item She went out to the Crimean War, to Scutari in Turkey, in 1854.
    \item She found that not even the numbers of soldiers entering the hospitals, or leaving them – alive or dead – was known.
    \item From the first she kept meticulous records.
    \item The data she collected was the evidence that saved lives.
    \item She was the first to use statistical graphics to present data in a way that was easy to understand.
    \item She is credited with developing a form of the pie chart now known as the polar area diagram.
    \item She reformed healthcare in the United Kingdom and is considered the founder of modern nursing.
